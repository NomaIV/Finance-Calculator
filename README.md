## Capstone Project Details

### The Task at Hand

In this Capstone Project, you will create a Python program that includes two financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

### Compulsory Task

1. Create a new Python file named `finance_calculators.py`.
2. Import the `math` module at the top of the file.
3. Implement the following functionalities based on user input:
   - For 'investment', calculate either simple or compound interest based on user inputs (principal, interest rate, time, and type of interest).
   - For 'bond', calculate monthly repayments based on the present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months.

### Example Usage

Upon running `finance_calculators.py`, the program will display a menu allowing the user to choose between investment and bond calculations. Depending on the selection, the program will guide the user through entering the necessary information and provide the calculated results accordingly.
